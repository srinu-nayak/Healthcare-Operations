# Background & Overview
Effective management of patient waiting lists is a critical challenge in healthcare operations. It directly impacts patient satisfaction, resource allocation, and clinical outcomes. This analysis was commissioned to provide a centralized, dynamic, and interactive tool to replace static, manually-compiled reports.

Operational and clinical leadership lacked a consolidated, timely view of waiting list volumes. It was difficult to identify bottlenecks, understand historical trends across different case types (Inpatient vs. Outpatient), or analyze which specialties were under the most pressure. This reporting gap hindered effective resource planning and strategic decision-making.

This dashboard was developed to provide a "single source of truth" for waiting list metrics. Key questions addressed include:
- What is the current total patient waiting list, and what is its composition (Inpatient vs. Outpatient)?
- What are the historical monthly trends in waiting list volume, and how do they compare year-over-year?
- Which medical specialties and patient age profiles represent the largest bottlenecks?
- What is the difference between $Average$ and $Median$ wait times, and what does this discrepancy reveal about outliers?
